          <h2>Importance of AI</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.</p>
          <h2>History of AI (Trivias)</h2>
          <p>• The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined by computer scientist John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference.</p>
